# Notebook example

The following notebooks provide runnable examples of the package functionality:

- [Pegasus classifiers](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FPerceptron.ipynb)
- [Neural Networks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FNn.ipynb)
  - [Bike sharing demand forecast (daily data)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%NN - Bike sharing demand forecast (daily db).ipynb)
- [Clustering](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl/master?filepath=notebooks%2FClustering.ipynb)


Note: the live, runnable computational environment is a temporary new copy made at each connection. The first time after a commit is done on this repository a new environment has to be set (instead of just being copied), and the server may take several minutes.

This is only if you are the unlucky user triggering the rebuild of the environment after the commit.
